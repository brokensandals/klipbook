# Klipbook

Klipbook creates a nice html summary of the clippings you've created on your Kindle.

## How does it work?

Copy your clippings file (called "My Clippings.txt" on a 3rd generation Kindle) from your Kindle device to your local drive via USB.

**List the books in your clippings file:**

    $ klipbook list "My Clippings.txt"

    The list of books in your clippings file:
    [1] The Big Sleep by Raymond Chandler
    [2] How to jump out of a plane without a parachute and survive by Rip Rockjaw

**Print a html summary for the book of your choice:**

Choose the number of the book you are interested in and print a html summary with the `summarise` command:

    $ klipbook summarise "My Clippings.txt" 1 big-sleep-clippings.html

Keep the nicely formatted html version of your clippings for your own reference.

## Installation

## Tested platforms
